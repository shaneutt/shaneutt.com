Konvoy Managed Kubernetes Platform
===

After a long year of work my company both renamed and rebranded, and my team and I finally shipped the managed [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) platform "[Konvoy](https://d2iq.com/solutions/ksphere/konvoy)" we had been developing this year.

Konvoy is a "turn-key" Kubernetes distribution which provides an easy to set up and maintain [certified Kubernetes distro](https://www.cncf.io/certification/software-conformance/). It comes with a range of default addons which are deployed by default and include managed configurations, and at it's best it's `konvoy up` and then you have a fully operational Kubernetes cluster at your disposal.

It was a lot of work, and was ultimately very rewarding to develop and ship this software and I'm very excited to continue working on Kubernetes at [D2iQ](https://d2iq.com) and take our work to [Kubecon](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-north-america-2019/) this year where I'll be speaking about the project.

I'll be working on some blog posts using Konvoy as the year progresses, happy coding!
