Welcome to my new blog!
===

This blog uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) to generate fast static content, and [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) for hosting.

See the source for this site [on Github](https://github.com/shaneutt/shaneutt.com)!

If you're looking to create your own blog, I highly recommend checking out the ["getting started" documenation for Hugo](https://gohugo.io/overview/introduction/), and the docs for [using Hugo with Github pages](https://gohugo.io/tutorials/github-pages-blog/).

Soon I'll start adding some more posts after I've imported my old ones from the previous blog.

Happy coding!
