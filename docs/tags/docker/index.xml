      <description>Fast + Small Docker Image Builds for Rust Apps In this post I&#39;m going to demonstrate how to create small, quickly built Docker Images for Rust applications.
We&#39;ll start by creating a simple test application, and then building and iterating on a Dockerfile.
Requirements Ensure you have the following installed:
 rustup v1.14.0+ docker v17.06.2+  Setup: demo app setup Make sure you have and are using the latest stable Rust with rustup:</description>

The dockerfileis relatively simple:
The script used to start the Riak service takes care of some basic configuration and then tails the logs:</description>
